## 🚀 The ROCAT Methodology

The framework is built upon five core pillars that define the operational boundaries and goals of the AI agents:

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Defines the persona, expertise, and "voice" of the specific AI agent. |
| **Objective** | The primary goal or outcome the agent is expected to achieve. |
| **Constraint** | The boundaries, limitations, and ethical/technical guardrails for the task. |
| **Application Specification** | The technical requirements, data formats, and environmental context. |
| **Tasks** | The granular, step-by-step actions required to fulfill the objective. |
