  | Component | Description |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | **Role** | Defines the persona, expertise, and "voice" of the specific AI agent. |
  | **Objective** | The primary goal or outcome the agent is expected to achieve. |
  | **Constraint** | The boundaries, limitations, and ethical/technical guardrails for the task. |
  | **Application Specification** | The technical requirements, data formats, and environmental context. |
  | **Tasks** | The granular, step-by-step actions required to fulfill the objective. |
